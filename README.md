# Valine API

Forge Energy/Fluid API clone but now it handles larger numbers, called "Valine Energy" and "Valine Buckets".

## Warning

This API *may* affect your game performance, as it uses BigDecimal to handle larger numbers. Use it at your own risk.

## Valine Energy

Valine Energy API is implemented same as Forge Energy API, but using BigDecimal instead of Integers.
